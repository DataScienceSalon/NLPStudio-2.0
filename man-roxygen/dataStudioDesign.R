#' @section DataStudio Design:
#' This DataStudio family of classes is an implementation of the Strategy
#' and Command design patterns, as described in the book "Design Patterns:
#' Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software" by Erich Gamma, Richard
#' Helm, Ralph Johnson and John Vlissides (hence Gang of Four). The
#' Strategy pattern defines and encapsulates the family of data processing
#' classes and allows text cleaning algorithms to be selected and
#' exhanged at runtime. THe Command pattern defines commands that
#' can be executed in batch mode or at a later time.
