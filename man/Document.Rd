keys associated a metadata field or fields.}

the key vector, containing the metadata value or values.}

\description{
\code{Document} Class for creating, managing, reading and writing Document content and metadata.
}
\details{
Class contains Document content and metadata for the Document object.
The object may be instantiated with a name and character
vectors containing the Document text. Once the object is created, users may
add, change and remove metadata via key / value pairs. IO
methods support reading and writing the Documents in a variety
of formats using the \code{\link[NLPStudio]{IOFactory}} factory
class.
}
\section{Core Methods}{

 \itemize{
  \item{\code{new(x = NULL, name = NULL)}}{Initializes an object of the Document class.}
  \item{\code{content(value)}}{Active binding method for updating Document text content.}
  \item{\code{read(path, repair = FALSE)}}{Reads text from a file designated by the path variable.
  If repair is set to TRUE, select ASCII control characters are replaced with spaces
  using \code{\link[NLPStudio]{RepairFile}} }
  \item{\code{write(path)}}{Writes the Document object content to a file in plain text format.}
  \item{\code{summary(core = TRUE, stats = TRUE, state = TRUE, system = TRUE,
  quiet = FALSE, abbreviated = FALSE)}}{Summarizes Document object.}
 }
}

\section{Metadata Method}{

 \itemize{
  \item{\code{meta(key = NULL, value = NULL)}}{Provides facility for
  managing an object's metadata represented as key/value pairs in
  a list format. Metadata may be indicated via single key and
  value character strings or by pairs of character vectors. If
  no parameters are passed to the method, then it returns the
  current metadata, as well as system generated application
  and system metadata, in data frame format. If a character
  string or vector is passed via the key parameter, the value
  or values associated with the keys are returned.}
  \item{\code{log(cls = class(self)[1], event = NULL)}}{Class for posting to and
  retrieving an object's log. If the event parameter is provided,
  the event is posted to the object's log and the log is returned
  invisibly.  If the event parameter is NULL, the existing log
  is returned.}
}
